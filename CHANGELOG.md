# Changelog

Changes of the `fitplotter` project are documented in this file

## 2021-03-03

- tkl-parser is added;
- massive refactoring to split loadfile function from the calculations;
- added "update Map" button;
- fixed bug with loaded files droplist, now each loaded file  brings the own yaxes droplist. This enables to compare data on the same tracks but with different watches, what is especially useful by working with the data in the span of several years.  

## 2021-03-01

- Added droplist for the loaded files;
- Added button to clean map;
